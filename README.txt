Our project has been tested to compile and run with OCaml version 4.03.0 and
Yojson version 1.3.2.  From the source code directory, the following commands
can be run: "make", "make clean", and "make play".

Running "make" or "make play" will compile the game engine into the file
"main.byte"; "make play" will also launch the game automatically.   Running
"make clean" will delete "main.byte" and other files generated by the build
system.

When the game start, a main menu will be displayed, from which there are 3
available commands:

1 - Player vs Player Game
2 - Player vs AI Game
3 - Quit

If a command other than those specified above is given, you will be prompted
to try again with a valid command.

In both of the two possible game modes, you will be prompted to specify a .json
file for each player.  These must be valid .json files in the same directory as
main.ml, and they must follow the schema defined in schema.json.  We've provided
two sample decks, "basic.json" and "cs_deck.json", to be used for grading, but
feel free to make your own decks to play with!

At the start of each game, both players are given 30 health points
